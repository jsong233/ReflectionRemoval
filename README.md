# Project Overview

We aimed to remove the undesired reflections when taking pictures through transparent glasses. The existing
“ghosting model” failed to process pictures with repetitive patterns. After I modified the model and proposed a new
regularization term in the optimization problem, my algorithm achieved better performances than the original one on
both artificial images and some of the natural images.
